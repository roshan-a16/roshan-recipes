<h1> Cranberry Spaghetti </h1>
<p>
   Directions
Cook and stir ground beef and sausage in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, breaking up chunks with a spatula, until browned and crumbly, about 7 minutes. Strain the grease and return meat to the pot.

Add 3 jars spaghetti sauce to the pot and bring to a simmer.

In a small bowl, mash cranberry sauce with a fork and add to meat sauce. Continue cooking for 10 minutes.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and set aside to keep warm.

Combine ricotta and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl and set aside.

Serve meat sauce over angel hair pasta and top with a dollop of ricotta mixture. Serve immediately.
