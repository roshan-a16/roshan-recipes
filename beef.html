<h1> How to Cook Steak on the Grill</h1>
<p>
    Now that you've prepped your meat, learn step-by-step how to cook steak on the grill:

    1.If your steak was marinating, wipe off the wet marinade with a paper towel, then set it down on the hot grill and leave it alone for several minutes without turning.

    2.After a few minutes, the meat will release its grip on the grill, and you can turn it without tearing the meat; If you start to turn it, and it's still gripping the grill, just give it another minute.

    3.Sear steaks over high, direct heat, then move them to indirect heat to finish cooking. That's the most common method. But if you like to live dangerously, do it in reverse: start with indirect cooking, with the lid on, and then finish with a quick, high-heat sear. You'll get the same results: a juicy steak with a crisp, caramelized crust.

    4.Once your steak is done to your liking, remove it to a plate and let it sit for at least 5 minutes before serving or slicing.
